Please note that this is an updated version (ALMM_v1), the main improvement lies in the following three parts:
1) the updated code is able to input non-grid HSI (e.g., the size is 107 * 107, not only limiting to e.g., 100 * 100);
2) a blind ALMM code is added in this toolbox as well, which enables simultaneous abundance estimation and endmember extraction;
3) we correct a problem that the final abundance maps can not be imshown correctly.

The code in this toolbox implements the "An augmented linear mixing model to address spectral variability for hyperspectral unmixing".
More specifically, it is detailed as follow

Please kindly cite the papers if this code is useful and helpful for your research.

System-specific notes
---------------------
The code was tested in Matlab R2016a version on Windows 10 machines.

How to use it?
---------------------

Directly run demo.m to reproduce the results on the synthetic data, which exists in the aforementioned paper.

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data) and tune the parameters.
Please note that 
1) the shape of the input matrix.
2) when you are running the code in parallel, that is, you have to seperate the input HSI into some patches,
in our code, the patch must be square (length = width).
3) if the endmemebers are not given in advance, the code would automatically extract the endmembers from HSI using VCA [1].

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
